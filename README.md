# Nexus: Bringing LLM Intelligence to the Terminal

Nexus is a locally run chatbot that demonstrates the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) on your own machine. It prioritizes user privacy and offline functionality by utilizing Ollama to serve models like LLaMA3, eliminating the need for cloud-based APIs.

## Features

Nexus provides a powerful and private AI assistant directly in your terminal:

* **Fully Offline Functionality:** Run Nexus without an internet connection, ensuring your data stays local.
* **Powered by LLaMA3:** Enjoy intelligent and context-aware conversations driven by Meta's state-of-the-art LLaMA3 language model.
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Interact with Nexus through a lightweight and efficient terminal interface.
* **Modular and Maintainable Codebase:** The Python codebase is designed for easy extension and customization.
* **Quick Setup and Deployment:** Get up and running quickly with minimal dependencies.
* **Real-Time Response System:** Experience fluid and natural conversations with instant responses.
* **Error Resilience:** The system is designed to handle common errors gracefully.
* **Lightweight Resource Usage:** Nexus is designed to run efficiently on modest hardware.

## Technology Stack

Nexus is built using the following technologies:

* **Ollama:** A tool for running LLMs locally.
* **LLaMA3:** The Large Language Model powering Nexus's intelligence.
* **Python:** The scripting language used to handle communication and logic.
* **Command-Line Interface (Terminal):** The user interface for interacting with Nexus.
* **Local Operating System Environment (Linux, macOS, Windows with WSL):** The platform for running Nexus.

## System Architecture

Nexus follows a simple and modular architecture:

1.  **User Interface Layer (Terminal):** Handles user input and displays chatbot responses.
2.  **Application Logic Layer (Python Script):** Manages communication between the user and the LLM.
3.  **Model Serving Layer (Ollama + LLaMA3):** Runs the LLaMA3 model and generates responses.

## Limitations

Nexus, in its current state, has the following limitations:

* Lack of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
* No Long-Term Memory
* Limited Personalization
* Hardware Constraints (requires sufficient RAM)
* No Background Tasks or Multi-threading
* No Integrated Logging or Analytics

## Future Scope

The following enhancements are planned for future versions of Nexus:

* Frontend Integration (GUI)
* Conversation Memory
* Custom Personality and Prompts
* Voice Input & Output
* Plugin System for tool integration
* Model Switching Support
* Security Enhancements
